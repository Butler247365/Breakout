# Breakout

A summary of the project goals
1.	Set the scene, by making rows of blocks
2.	Add Ball bouncing
3.	Add keyboard motion with the paddle at the bottom of the screen
4.	Make sound effect when ball hits paddle
5.	Make sound effect with ball hits blocks
6.	Remove blocks when hit
7.	Make the player lose when ball hits ground
8.	Make player win when no blocks left
9. 	Make a start screen
10.	Make a game over screen


Instructions the player may need
The overview is simple: the user controls a paddle, trying to hit a bouncing ball, and colliding with bricks at the top. The paddle appears at the bottom in front of a black background. The user can move the paddle left and right using the arrows on the keyboard. The bouncing ball will move left and right at 2 to 5 pixels and fall 2 to 5 pixels starting at a random place up at the top, making it challenging but not impossible. The bricks will be different rows starting at red at the top and working down he rainbow to blue by the fifth row. When the ball hits the brick, it will break and disappear and bounce in the opposite direction. The goal is to hit all the bricks before the ball hits the bottom of the screen. 
When the game starts, it will show a screen with instructions in the middle and two buttons underneath, allowing the player to start or quit. 
When the ball leaves the screen and not all the bricks are hit, the player will lose, and it will show them how long they lasted. When all the bricks have been hit, the player wins, showing them the time it took. Both screens will allow the player to restart or quit.

What did you learn?
I learned how important it is to do one thing at a time, and set goals. I often find myself overwhemled if I look at the end product.

Where did you get stuck?
I got stuck one how to make each block, and how to remove each.

What would you like to improve?
I would like to improve the randomness of the ball bouncing to make it more difficult.

How would you do things differently next time?
I would take more breaks as I go on, and give myself more time.

How far did you stray from the game design document?
Not to far, I added timer instead of score. I should have stuck with score.

How did you stay on track?
I had the main design down, and stayed to that.
